# Reflection on Week 00 and 01 (Savonna Beard)

For week 00 there was a pretty straight forward soolution to the issue of finding the smallest integer that was expressed during class.
I began to overthink some of the criteria for how to find it and although it seems that my code was very similar 
I believe that my lines 98-102 were formatted a little bit differently.

My return method was a shortened version of the one given in the solution.
The solution provided a more detailed format that probably plays nicer with the compiler than the one I submitted.
One thing I learned from that lab is to take a problem bit by bit instead of focusing on the end result.

For week 01 I believe my solution was more congruent to the longer format solution provided in the java file.
I felt like there was certain logic that I couldn't quite picture in my mind how to simplify even though I knew it was possible.
I do recall having issues with the compiler which proabably was a result of redundancy in the code or something relatively simple.
Overall I would sat that I was on the right track both weeks with minor inconsistencies with logic and I am to better correct that with becoming 
more familiar with phrasing when I want to accomplish a certain machine behavior with my code.
